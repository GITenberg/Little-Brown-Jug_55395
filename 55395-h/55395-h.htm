<p><i>John.</i> Wal, neow, Jarius, depend upon it, there’s
nothin’ like a stiddy, in-door-work life to give a man
position in the world. Yeou city fellers may do all
the schemin’ yeou like; but when the time comes for
action, it’s the farmers and the shoemakers that find the
bone and sinew to keep the world a joggin’, whether in
provisions or politics. You peddle, and we provide; you
scheme, and we vote. My grandsir was a shoemaker,
so was my daddy, so am I, and I mean that my boy
Will, there, shall foller in the footsteps of his father.
P’raps ’tain’t what you might call a high calling; but
boots and shoes, taps and patches, are always wanted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
will be jest as long as gineration succeeds gineration;
and when you’ve got a trade like mine, p’raps you can’t
hoard up much money, but you’ve got a sure hold on the
staff of life.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so, John, jes’ so; that’s mighty good
argifying, if a feller critter hain’t got no soul above peggin’
souls. But that air Will of yourn has got the city
fever the wust kind. He’s hankering for a chance to try
his fortune among the money-catchers. Consarn it, give
the boy a chance. There’s no hay-seed in his hair.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> That’s right, Jarius; peg away. I never shall
take kindly to this work. Hammer and sew, patch and
peg. Bah! I’m tired of it! It’s so awful slow! I want
to see the world, rub elbows with bustling fellows, set my
wits at work, use my tongue, wrestle with sharp ones for
the best end of a bargain. That’s life!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. You’re a lively young colt&mdash;you
are. It’s a shame you can’t have a prance in the city.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes; you’re a pretty chap to set a lad’s head
a whizzing&mdash;you are, Jarius Jordan. You’ve been
everything by turn, and nothing long.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so, John, jes so. But I calkilate that
with every turn I’ve give myself a h’ist in the world, anyhow.
I’ve peddled tin ware, wooden ware, hardware,
everywhere. I’ve swapped horses, traded in cattle, druv
hogs, and raised poultry. I’ve invented cotton gins, reapers,
and mowers, cider presses and match safes, travelled
with pictures, poetry books, stationery, and Bibles. I’ve
dug gold, mined copper, and bored ile; fit Ingins, Mexicans,
and sesesh; kept school, led a choir, taught singing-school,
been a deacon in regular standing. I’ve been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
printer, a book-binder, a counter-jumper, and an insurance
agent, and other things too numerous to mention.
There’s three things I never took a hand in&mdash;swearin’,
lyin’, and drinkin’. I’ve got a clean conscience and a
bank-book full of figgers. I despise meanness, hate
misers, and am down on rascality like all possessed. So,
you see, John, with all my rolling, I’ve gathered <em>some</em>
moss, and am none the wuss for it.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> No, indeed. There’s not a better fellow living
than Jarius Jordan.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> O, git eout! Don’t yeou go to tootin’ the
horn.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> It’s the truth. ’Twould have been a hard winter
for widow Black, but for the kind care Jarius Jordan
bestowed upon her.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Sho! Don’t you tell tales out of school,
young feller.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Then there’s old Pearson. Who’d have kept
him out of the poorhouse, when he broke his leg, if Jarius
Jordan hadn’t stepped in, housed him all winter, and
paid the doctor’s bill?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> O, go along! D’ye want to spile my complexion?
Now, John, you just give Will a chance.
You’ll never regret it.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> I tell you, what’s good enough for the old man
is good enough for the boy. I’ll never give my consent
to his going into the city&mdash;never. I’m not going to send
my boy into that sink of iniquity, to be overcome by
temptation. So you jest shut up, Jarius. I’ve got an
awful temper, and if you rile me, I won’t answer for the
consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. But, speaking of temptations&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Hannah</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with a small brown jug.</i></p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Here, father, here’s your “’leven o’clock.”</p>

<p><i>John.</i> (<i>Dropping his work, and taking the jug.</i>) Ah,
that’s good.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Why, law sakes, Mr. Jerden!<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> How do you
do? The sight of you’s good for sore eyes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Hannah and Sally should follow this pronunciation.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Thank you, marm. I’m pretty well, considerin’.
Hope you’re hearty.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Me? Sakes alive! I never had an ache
or a pain in my life, and I’m goin’ on for sixty. There’s
nothin’ like good, wholesome work to keep off sickness.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes so, Mrs. Nutter.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rubbin’ and scrubbin’</div>
<div class="verse">Gives rust a drubbin’.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>John.</i> (<i>After a long pull at the jug.</i>) Ah, that’s good!
The raal Holland, sweetened to taste, and rousing hot!
Take a pull, Jarius?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> No, I thank ye.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> (<i>Takes a drink.</i>) Ah! Here, Will. (<i>Passes
jug to <span class="smcap">Will</span>, who grasps it eagerly, and drinks.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Sho! <em>Yeou</em> ain’t a going to drink that stuff!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Stuff? Hullo!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Stuff? Hear the critter!</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Stuff, indeed! When I mixed it myself,
and in the little brown jug, that’s been in the family
years and years!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. The jug is a relic?</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Yes, indeed; and we wouldn’t part with it
for the world. It’s been handed down from father to
son ever since the first Nutter landed in America.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> And used year in and year out. It’s seasoned
with the good grog of five generations.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Seen some tight times, I reckon.
Come, Ned, it’s your turn.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> No, I thank you. I never drink.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> (<i>Drinks.</i>) No? I stand his watch.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. So Ned don’t like it, hey?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Ned never tasted it, Mr. Jordan. My poor
mother’s last request was that I should never touch it.
Don’t you think a mother’s last request should be sacred?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Don’t I? As sacred as the family Bible.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> As sacred as the memory of the loved and lost.
I had a good mother, Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. You show it.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Yes, indeed; a poor, hard-working woman
was Marcy Hartshorn: the best washer and ironer in the
place; and such a cook! Her pies would make your
mouth water. And turnovers! the young ones would
cry for them. O, dear! such a pity she threw herself
away on that drunken sot&mdash;Jim Hartshorn. Why, when
he died&mdash;</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Hush, mother, hush!</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Dear me! I forgot. But it always makes
me mad when I think&mdash;(<i>sniffs</i>). Bless me! What’s
that? (<i>Sniffs.</i>) I smell something.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so&mdash;gin and sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> It’s my pies a-burning, as sure as I live!
And I here gossiping. O, dear! there’s a whole ovenful
spoiled by my neglect! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Don’t mind her, Ned. She didn’t mean to hurt
your feelings. She’d do anything in the world for you.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> I know she would. Heaven bless her! You
see, Mr. Jordan, liquor has left a stain on my family
name; and I’m not likely to be friendly with it.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Stick to the last request, young feller,
and you’ll wipe it out. And if ever you want a
friend, don’t forget the undersigned, Jarius Jordan, for
you’ll find him on hand, like a picked-up dinner.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> There; that job’s done. Here, Will, drop that
jug. It’s a leetle strong to-day. Put on your coat, and
take these shoes to Mrs. Douglas.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> (<i>Rises while speaking, takes off apron, puts on
coat and hat, sets the jug on the floor beside <span class="smcap">John Nutter’s</span>
bench.</i>) That’s just the job for me. Hen Douglas
sent me word he wanted to see me. So I can kill two
birds with one stone. (<i>Takes shoes.</i>) The Holland is a
leetle strong, and no mistake. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> See here, John Nutter, I’m a b’ilin’ and a
b’ilin’, an’ if I don’t let off steam, there’ll be a case of
spontaneous combustion in my in’ards. You’re a good
deal older than I am; but we’ve been good friends ever
since I was knee high to a woodchuck; so, hear me fust,
and lick me arterwards, if you don’t like it. Here you’ve
been a talking about the temptations of the city, and putting
that inter your boy’s mouth that will work his etarnal
destruction! Your little brown jug will be his evil
genius. Mind what I say. He hankers arter it now;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and you, here in the country, are tempting him, and
making an appetite that’ll eat him up soul and body.
And now he’s off to meet that air Douglas, who always
has a bottle at his elbow. He’s a dangerous chap.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Much you know about it. He’s Will’s friend.
He’s taken a shine to him, and, if I’d say the word, would
give him a great lift in the city. He’s a well-meaning
chap, that Douglas. He’s got a rich father, and need not
work. He’s well edicated, and has got good manners.
Will’s all the better for being in company with such a man.
As for the little brown jug, don’t abuse that. It never
did me any harm, and I was as young as Will when I
took my first pull at it. So, don’t you meddle, Jarius.
When I find things going wrong in my family, I’ll take
’em in hand myself.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Look here, John. I’ve taken a
fancy to that boy myself. Give me his time, and I’ll
put in your hand, to-day, five hundred dollars, and guarantee
you a thousand more, if I don’t make a man of him
when he’s twenty-one.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> (<i>Rising.</i>) You can’t have him. I’ve just had
enough of your meddling. If I wanted him to go, I’d
make terms with Mr. Douglas, and not you. He shall
never go with my leave; and he knows that if he goes
without, he never returns here. You’re pretty flush with
your money, Jarius, but you haven’t enough to buy
that boy’s time, nor logic enough, sharp as you think
yourself, to turn my purpose. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Stubborn as a mule. Douglas will
get that boy in spite of thunder. I do hate to see that
young feller go to the dogs; as he’s sure to do if something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
don’t hinder. He’s jest the chap to go into Stinson’s
good graces, and gain a complete knowledge of
agricultural implements in his concern, and jest the lad
to keep a sharp eye on my interest in the patent reaper.
I do hate to get eucred; but old Nutter’s a hard lot
when he gets his back up.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Sally</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Goodness gracious! If I’ve been here once,
I’ve been here twenty times for Mrs. Douglas’s shoes,
and she ravin’ distracted about ’em! Such a dawdlin’
set as you shoemakers are!&mdash;Sakes, Mr. Jerden, heow
dew yeou dew? I didn’t see yeou before.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>On her entrance puts up his knife, takes off
his hat, and tries to smooth his hair, and appears very
sheepish and awkward while she remains.</i>) Jes’ so, Miss
Higgins; business first, and pleasure arterwards.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Don’t fret about the shoes, Sally. Will has just
taken them to the house.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Well, thank goodness, that’s settled.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Heow’s yeour marm, Miss Peeslee?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Rather peaked, Mr. Jerden; and jest when I
ought to be at home, I’m kept at the big house and worked
like a dog. Such a set of cross-grained folks you never
did see. Old Mr. Douglas as proud and stiff as a grannydear,
Mrs. Douglas frettin’ and worryin’ the livelong
day about nothin’, and that good-for-nothin’ Hen of theirs
a carryin’ on all sorts of didos. He and the old gentleman
had an awful quarrel this mornin’. Somehow Mr.
Douglas got it into his head that Hen was sparking Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Nutter in airnest. Don’t believe such a notion ever entered
the feller’s head afore. He’s only flirtin’ with her,
same as he has with twenty other girls; but, to spite the
old man, he swore&mdash;O, awful!&mdash;he’d marry her, if he
was turned out of doors for it.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> He marry our Mary!</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Why not? He’s none too good for her.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> She’s too good for him.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Why, Ned, you ain’t sweet on her&mdash;are
you?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Me? I should not dare. But he’s a worthless
spendthrift, thinks only of his own pleasure, regardless
of others’ feelings, selfish, dissipated, cunning, and crafty.
He marry Mary! Heaven forbid!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. He cuts a mighty big swell on an
awful small capital.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> He’s good looking, and that goes a long way
with girls. I don’t think Mary would break her heart
if she knew she was to be his wife.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> No; but, once in his possession, he would break
it. Many whispers of his wild life in the city have been
blown to our ears.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> He’s a communion merchant&mdash;ain’t he?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> A commission merchant, Sally.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. I’ve heard of him. He’s got a
shingle, a desk, and a chair. The shingle hangs at
the door; he sits in the chair and watches his legs on
the desk, through tobacco smoke; and that’s the extent
of his business.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> He wants to take Will Nutter off there, to
learn the business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. And, with the edication he’s receiving
here, he’ll make a capital assistant in the smoking department.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Land sakes! I can’t stop here spinning shop
yarn. Good by. Nothing new&mdash;is there? I haven’t
been out of the house for a week.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Nothing special, Miss Peeslee. Harris has
lost the suit and the cow.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> I want to know!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Mrs. Prime as buried her husband last week;
has gone to Jarsey to modify her grief.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Poor Mrs. Prime! How I pity her!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. She lost a prime husband, that’s a
fact. He was the best feller on a fishing frolic you
ever see. Parson Lucas has resigned, and they do say
the parish is resigned to his resigning, too. They’ve got
a new bell-rope onto the second parish. Mrs. Jones’s
expectations has turned out a bouncing boy&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> What! another?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> That’s what they say. Molly Moses had a
candy scrape last night, and Si Jones went home with his
hair full. Bunsen has got a new lot of calicoes&mdash;prime
ones, fast colors. And Joe Britton has killed his hog.
But there’s no news.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> No weddin’, no nothin’? I don’t hear anythin’
about your marriage, Mr. Jerden.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Don’t you? Well, that’s queer. I ben about
it every time I come home. But it’s all talk and no cider.
No, Miss Peeslee, I’m an unplucked apple on the tree
of life. But, to return the compliment, I don’t hear nothin’
’bout your gittin’ spliced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Me? I guess not. It’s time enough to think
about that when mother is able to take care of herself.
I won’t say I haven’t had a chance, Mr. Jerden; but my
first duty is to her; and I mean to work my fingers to
the bone, if need be, that the old home may shelter her
as long as she lives.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. So you gave Si Slocum the mitten?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Yes, I did,&mdash;the worthless scamp!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Then Deacon Sassafras wanted you to take
the place of his late departed&mdash;didn’t he?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> He wanted a drudge, the mean old skinflint!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Why, he’s rich&mdash;the deacon is.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> But awful mean. I don’t see how they trust
him up behind the singing-seats with the contribution
box Sundays. I wouldn’t.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Josh Higgins was kinder smitten
one time&mdash;hey, Miss Peeslee.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Well, p’raps he was, and p’raps he wasn’t. He
was too much smitten with whiskey for me.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Well, Sally&mdash;Miss Peeslee&mdash;you’re
a smart gal; and if I want so pesky busy with my new
reaper&mdash;I’d&mdash;I’d&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Well, what would you do, Mr. Jerden?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> I’d jest look round and pick out a smart husband
for you.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> You needn’t trouble yourself, Mr. Jerden. I
can pick for myself when I git ready. Better be lookin’
out for yourself. You do want slicking up, and a wife
would soon reduce that crop of hair to its proper dimensions,
mend that hole in your elbow, iron out that ruffled,
seedy-looking hat, and find a blacking-brush for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
those rusty boots. If I wasn’t so busy, Jarius&mdash;Mr.
Jerden&mdash;I’d look round and find you a wife, for you do
need one awfully. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Neow there’s a gal I’ve been hankerin’
arter for five years, and never so much as dared
ask her to lecter or singin’-school. Consarn it, Jarius,
you’re a mealy-mouthed critter among the gals, smart as
you are at tradin’ and swappin’. It’s no sorter use; the
minute that gal comes a-near me, there’s a sinkin’ at my
stomach that no end of vittles can’t fill up. Smart?
Why, she beats all nater; and I kinder think she likes
me, and gin those chaps the go-by on my account. Come,
come, Jarius, spunk up! Don’t be a fool! Say the
word, and she’s yourn for better or for wus. I’ll put
arter her, and spit it out to once. (<i>Goes to door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Yes&mdash;no&mdash;no. I was going to see Joe
Bristles’ hog.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> O, yes. “Birds of a feather,” you know.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> to <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Hen Douglas marry Mary Nutter! O, Heaven
forbid! What a dear good girl she is! The sound of
her voice, as she merrily sings at her work, sets my hammer
flying glibly, and my heart beating quickly, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
’Twill be called a good match, for he has money, and she
is the most capable girl in the place. She would grace
the handsomest house that his money could furnish. But
could he make her happy? He, with his foppish airs,
his love of display, delight in reckless dissipation! No,
no. He would tire of her in a week, and then, with some
new fancy luring him, turn coldly from her, perhaps
abuse her, and break her heart. Break her heart! O,
Mary, Mary! For the first time in my life I long for
wealth, for then I should have the power to enter the
field, and, if I could not win you for myself, at least save
you from a heartless man.</p>

poverty; with every punch of my awl I see success;
with every pull of the threads I gain a long pull and a

than a nabob! He’s in the way. Mary is too fond of
him; and he, with that jealous glitter in his eye, too
much in love with her for my comfort. He must be got
rid of. Pshaw, Douglas! What chance could a poor
journeyman shoemaker have with the lady of your
choice? Rich, accomplished, by no means a bad-looking
fellow, the whole family would be delighted to gain so
distinguished a connection. And she, I know, looks upon
me with favor. I have only to gain the old man’s consent.
And that’s an easy matter. Still, I don’t like the
idea of this fellow’s presence. He must be got rid of.
But how? Will! Ah, there’s a ready tool. I want
him in the city. There’s a little sharp practice in which
I want a second hand to work; and Will’s the lad. If I
can only get him to pick a quarrel with Ned Hartshorn,
bring them to blows, and thus arouse the old man’s temper,
they’ll both be turned out of doors. Will would be
mine, and the other out of the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Will, but quite accidentally. You see, Ned
provoked him, and, quite accidentally&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> No such thing. Don’t play sneak, Hen. I did
it, old man, to uphold the honor of the family.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Will Nutter, you’re drunk.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Drunk yourself, you old fool. O, I ain’t afraid
of you. I’ve been tied to your leather apron long
enough. Now I’m going to see the world. D’ye hear
that, old man? No more pegs for me. You can have
the little brown jug to yourself now. I’ve had a taste
of something better&mdash;something stronger. It’s roused
the man in me. So I’m off. Good by.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> That’s all right&mdash;just the sort. Don’t want to
see it again. Hope you’ll live long and prosper, and,
when you die, leave a nice little fortune to yours, truly.
Good by.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Don’t mind him, sir. I’ll take care of him.
You see how he is. Come, Will. (<i>Drags him to the
door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> I say, old man, I’m off to fame and fortune.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Fame and fortune? Disgrace and infamy!
Will, I’ll give you one more chance. Return to your
bench, and all shall be forgotten. Leave this place now,

you were dying on the doorstep. Choose now, and

your steps, and life be to you a failure and a burden.
Away, and bear with you a father’s bitter, bitter&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Running to him, and putting her arms around

<p><i>Mary.</i> Poor fellow, he’s asleep at last. What a terrible
year it has been for him! That cruel blow stretched
him on a bed of sickness, from which we feared he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
would rise. Only a good constitution and careful nursing
have saved him from death, and saved Will from
worse than death&mdash;the stain of murder. O, Will, if you
only knew how we have fought to save you from that,
how we have prayed for Ned’s recovery, your heart might
be touched with remorse. Surely Henry Douglas must
have told him of his danger. He says he has. But
not a word, not a line comes from him. A whole year
has passed. We have watched and waited. Mother’s
once bright cheek has grown pale. Father, though he
says not a word, starts at every footfall. But yet no sign
of his return.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Now, Jarius, if you don’t stop, I’ll scream.
Murder, murder! (<i>Wakes.</i>) Bless my soul! Have I
been dreaming?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes, Sally, of Jarius.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> It’s no sech thing. Leastwise, dreams go by
contraries. I thought that Jarius Jerden had his arm
around my neck, and was going to kiss me; so I hollered.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> As dreams go by contraries, you wouldn’t
scream if he really had.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Yes, I would. What do I care for Jarius Jerden?
He’s forever pokin’ his nose in here when he
ain’t wanted. I’ll give him a piece of my mind some
day, see if I don’t.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> That will be very satisfactory to him, no
doubt, when he pops the important question.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> He? Jarius Jerden pop the question? He’ll
never do it. He hain’t the courage. He jest comes here,
and sits and whistles, sighs and whittles, and talks about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Squire Jones and his cattle, and sich nonsense. I’ve no
patience with him. If I was a man, I’d just know which
side my bread was buttered on in short order.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Sally, Sally!</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Yes, marm.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Your bread’s run onto the
floor, the fire’s all out, and the cat’s in the cream.&mdash;Scat!
scat!</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Dear me! What a chapter of accidents! And
I here dreaming! O, these men, these men! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah, Sally, ’twill be a happy day for you when
Jarius Jordan musters up courage enough to ask you to
be his wife. There’ll be a prompt answer on your part,
I’ll warrant. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) And a happy life,
which you so richly deserve, will be the sequel to this
queer wooing. Heigho!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> (<i>Who has crept up behind her chair.</i>) That
sigh was touching, Mary. Was it meant for me?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Starting up.</i>) Mr. Douglas! You here?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Does that surprise you? Where should I
be but in the presence of her I love&mdash;of the angelic being
who has promised to be my wife? (<i><span class="smcap">Ned</span> wakes, and,
leaning on his elbow, listens.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> That was a great while ago.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> A year only. Surely you have not repented
of your promise.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I have.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Ho, ho! So this is the meaning of the
coldness which I have felt creeping into our intercourse
of late&mdash;you repent your promise!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Mr. Douglas, listen to me. A year ago I was
a giddy girl, proud to be noticed by one so high in the
social sphere as you. Your attentions to me, while other
girls in vain sought to attract you, dazzled me, caused a
fluttering in my silly bosom, which I then thought was
love, and I gave you encouragement; nay, I will confess
it, promised to be your wife. We were very happy here
in our family circle then&mdash;very. But, alas! trouble
came. You know how. My brother fled; our dear Ned
was struck down; I became his nurse; by night and by
day I watched by his couch; and in those long hours
what could I do but think, think, think? I thought of the
wide difference in our social position, how unsuited we
were for each other&mdash;you, with your fine talents and rich
connections, I, a poor girl, reared to hard work, with no
knowledge of the world outside our little village; and
then I looked into my heart, and somehow, I can’t explain
it, I felt there was no love there; that I never could
be happy as your wife; and so to-night I ask you to release
me.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Well, ’pon my word, here’s a confession!
Here’s a fine position for the heir of the Douglas name
and state. After my unremitting attentions for a year,
I am to be thrown aside, like a country bumpkin, at the
whim of a girl who don’t know her own mind! No, no,
Mary, I shall not release you. You’ll think better of it
to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes, better, for my resolve will be stronger.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> And that resolve is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Never to marry you, Henry Douglas. It is
best we have no misunderstanding now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> It is, indeed. So, so! While I have been
absent, my place has been taken in your heart by that
fool, Ned Hartshorn.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Mr. Douglas!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Yes; it’s as plain as the sun at noonday.
Stunned by a slight blow, he made that the pretext for a
long season of wasting sickness, that he might secure
your attention, that he might bill and coo in your face,
excite your compassion, and awake in your heart an answer
to his love. The hypocrite! With his youth and
strength, the blow he received should not have kept him
from his work a day. ’Twas a crafty trick.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Mr. Douglas!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Ay, a crafty trick. But it shall not succeed.
I have your promise; I have your father’s consent.
I will not release you.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Henry Douglas, you have spoken plainly, and
you have spoken falsely. ’Tis true he who lies there
loves me. I have read it in his pleading eyes; I have
heard it in the delirium of fever from his lips. But he
is as incapable of the meanness you would ascribe to him
as you are of an honorable thought. Shame, shame!
He has worked hard for an honest name. Poor fellow;
’tis all he has in the world!&mdash;and you, rich and powerful,
seek to rob him of that.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Mary!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Silence! I will not hear you. You have attacked
the honor of a dear friend, dearer for the infirmity
which has fallen upon him through the instrumentality
of one of my name. ’Tis but right I should stand forth
in his defence. Hear me. I asked you to release me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
from my promise; I gave you the reasons, good, true
reasons, which would have convinced an honorable man.
I have one more to give, which must convince you. I
can never be your wife, for your attack has revealed
something I hardly dreamed. I love Ned Hartshorn as
I can never love another.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Ha! The truth at last! There is no misunderstanding
now. Your last reason has convinced me.
Now hear one which must overpower yours, which must
convince you that I will not be trifled with. Your brother
Will and I parted company this morning.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Will and you! What mean you?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Yesterday, being the first of the month, my
book was returned to me from the Phœnix Bank, with the
checks which I had drawn during the month. I say, which
I had drawn. I’m wrong. There was one there for two
hundred dollars, signed by a clever imitation of my name,
of which I had no knowledge. It was a forgery.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> A forgery! Well?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Nay, ’twas very bad, for I found, upon investigation,
it had been done by your brother.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Will? No, no; you do not suspect him.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> I know he forged that check. This morning
I charged him with it. Of course he indignantly
denied it. I informed him, quietly, that I had no further
need of his services. He took his hat, and departed;
and there the matter rests. Of course I might have
called in an officer, and had him arrested; but, as he was
in a fair way to become my brother-in-law, that would
have been injudicious, to say the least.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> It would have killed my mother. But Will&mdash;where
is he now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> I haven’t the least idea. Of one thing be
certain&mdash;he will never trouble you with his presence.
His city life has not been a success. He will not return
to boast of it. Besides, should he appear here, I must
arrest him.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> You arrest him? No, no; that would be infamous.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> He is a criminal; he has robbed me, and
squandered my money. Why should I pardon him?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Because&mdash;because&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) O, Heavens,
I have lost the power to plead for him!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Mary, you <em>will</em> think better of your resolve.
You love your brother; he is in danger. If I but raise
my finger, disgrace and infamy are fastened upon him
forever. I would not willingly be the instrument of justice
in this case. I would not rob him of liberty; of the
opportunity to wipe out this disgrace. But you, to-night,
propose to rob me of my happiness; to blight my life by
withholding the treasure I covet&mdash;yourself. Think you
not, in such a case, revenge is justice?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> What would you have me do?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Fulfil your promise. Become my wife.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Still loving Ned Hartshorn?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Love that fool! I do not believe it. You
are too sensible a girl, Mary. No, no. When you are
my wife, this idle folly will be but a dream.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes, when I am your wife! And if I keep
my promise, my brother&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Shall not be molested. More, I will befriend
him, and place him in a good position.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Indeed! So I am to save my brother at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
cost of my love! Henry Douglas, the trick is worthy
of you; but it shall not move me. I love my brother,
Heaven knows; but not even to save him from prison
would I marry one who has suffered at his hands, by consenting
to become your wife.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> I have done. Justice must take its course.
Nay, I will not be conquered by so mean a foe. Your
father, your father, Mary, he shall decide whom he will
accept as his daughter’s husband,&mdash;I, rich, accomplished,
of good family, or that low, gawky clown.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Silence! He is a brave, noble, true man, who
would scorn to stoop to the petty tricks of the rich and
accomplished Henry Douglas. Let my father decide. I
care not. Every threat you utter but strengthens my resolution.
Do your worst. From your arms I would fly
to his, though I knew poverty and toil should be our
portion.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> As you please. But I shall not release you,
Mary Nutter. My wife you shall, you must be. You’ve
a stubborn father and a stubborn lover to fight. Arm
yourself, Mary; you will need all your strength, and then&mdash;I
shall win. Good night. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah, while there is life there is hope, even in a
bad cause. (<i>Turns, and sees <span class="smcap">Ned</span> looking at her.</i>) Why,
Ned, you awake?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Yes, Mary. I have heard all.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> What! No, no, Ned, not all!</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Yes, Mary, every word. O, it seems as though
a reviving draught had been poured through my veins,
and life, strong, healthy life was coming back to me.
Now I can speak, give utterance to that which you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
discovered, but which I, weak, distrustful, hid in my own
bosom. Now, Mary, I can tell you I love you.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ned, have I done right to break my promise?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Yes, Mary. You have obeyed the dictates of
your heart. Douglas is unworthy the rich prize he
seeks.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Had I known you were listening, Ned, I fear
my tongue would have refused to do its duty.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> And you love me?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes, Ned, with all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> O, you make me so happy! An hour ago life
seemed not worth living for; but now, with your love to
cheer me, all is bright and hopeful. It’s a glorious
world! and never fear but I will find a way to lead you,
not to toil and poverty, not to wealth and luxury, but to
a comfortable home, where the ring of my hammer and
the sound of your voice shall blend in sweet accord.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Why, Ned, what magic’s here? Your eye is
bright, your cheek glowing, your whole manner so unlike
you! I’m frightened.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Magic? The magic of a woman’s love, which
can transform age to youth, and make the dull heart beat
with healthy power. You smile on me, and I am strong
again.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Now be careful. Remember you are an invalid.
Bless me! how late it is! Come, you must to bed
at once. Remember I am your nurse still.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> O, I’ll obey. But I shan’t sleep a wink. Mary,
are you sure I’m not dreaming?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> There’s my hand. When you ask it, it is
yours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> (<i>Places his arm around her waist, takes her
hand and raises it to his lips.</i>) Mine! heart and hand
mine! No; I’m not dreaming. ’Tis a blessed reality.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Exeunt, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Knock at door, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, then it opens, and <span class="smcap">Jarius</span> sticks his
head in.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. (<i>Enters.</i>) Nobody to hum, or all
gone to roost, except Sally. That air female I jest
seen through the kitchen winder a slashin’ away in the
bread trough like all possessed. She’s a powerful gal&mdash;she
is. Her washin’ don’t hang round long arter
breakfast, I reckon. O, Sally, ef yeou only knew what
a powerful drubbin’ was goin’ on behind my ribs on your
account, you’d take pity and help a feller out somehow.
Plague take it! She knows it well enough. Didn’t I
start right off, a year ago, on her hint, and git my hair
cropped so short that I couldn’t lay on a piller, and
sneezed and snorted, and wore out handkerchers with
the influenza? Didn’t I go and git measured for a new
pair of boots, so tight that I hobbled all day and howled
all night with aching toes? Didn’t I git fitted to a bran
new coat, that bust up the back the fust time I wore it?
Ef that ain’t showin’ off one’s love, I’d like to know it!
But it’s no use. She won’t help a feller a bit. She
knows every time I come I’m a burnin’ to ask her to be
my wife. But I can’t say it. It gits jes’ so fur, and
there it sticks. Sally, I love you. Four words. I’m
blamed ef they ain’t a bigger load to git rid of than a
Fourth er July oration! But it’s no use. It’s got to
come. So, Jarius, don’t be a fool. Spit it out, and
she’s yourn. I will, the minute I see her. I won’t wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for nothin’, but jest shout, Sally&mdash;(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Sally</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span>,
with her hands and arms covered with flour.</i>) Sh, sh!
How do you do? (<i>Shakes hands quickly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Law sakes, Mr. Jerden, you’ve caught me this
time, sure enough! I’m up to my elbows in flour. So
jest excuse me a minute. (<i>Going, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> No, hold on a minute, or I shall bust. Now’s
the appointed time, Sally. Sally, I’ve got something
particular to say&mdash;Sally&mdash;Sally&mdash;old Hopkins has
got the yaller janders.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Wal, I declare! Is that the particular somethin’? (<i>Going, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> No, no. Hold on a minute. (<i>Catches her by
the arm; gets flour on his hands.</i>) ’Tain’t that. (<i>Aside.</i>)
Consarn it, there’s a cold chill runs up my back, and my
face is burnin’ up. (<i>Wipes his face with his hands, leaving
flour on it.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Why, Mr. Jerden, what is the matter with
you? You’re as pale as a ghost!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. O, Sally, hear me. Don’t look at
me, but open your ears. Pally Seeslee,&mdash;no, Sally Peeslee,&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I
think it’s going to rain. (<i>Aside.</i>) I can’t
do it.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Wal, what of it?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. It’ll put an end to the dry spell.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> It seems to me that you are having a very dry
spell about somethin’, Mr. Jerden.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Yes; jes’ so. Ha, ha, ha-h! That’s very
good!</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> I’ll be back before you want me, I guess. (<i>Going, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Don’t leave me. Hear me first, for I’m on
an awful strain, and if I once let up I’m a gone coon.
Sally, I want to say&mdash;I must say&mdash;Sally, I mean to say&mdash;how’s
your marm?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Why, Mr. Jerden, are you crazy? Mother’s
been dead and buried this six months.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> So she has. It’s no use asking arter her&mdash;is
it? That wan’t what I was going to say. To come
to the p’int, Sally, to come to the p’int, I&mdash;I&mdash;I don’t
feel well.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Then you’d better go home, tie up your ears,
and get to bed. It’s my opinion you’ve had a pint too
much, Jarius Jerden; and if ever you show yourself here
in that condition again, I’ll drown the pizen out of yer with
a kittle of hot water. Ain’t ye ashamed of yourself, at
your time of life making a fool of yourself in this way,
Jarius Jerden? I did think you had some sense; but
you’re nothing but a fool, arter all. Go home. Don’t
stand there staring at me in that way. Go to bed, sleep
it off, and rise in the morning a sadder and a wiser man.
O, Jarius, you, of all men! Wal, I never! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Sold again. And she thinks I’m
drunk! Never was drunk in all my life; but if the sensation
is anything like bein’ in love without the power
of tellin’ on it, then all I’ve got to say, it’s an all-fired
mean feelin’. Wal, things is gittin’ on backwards mighty
fast, anyhow. I’ve made a darned goose of myself, that’s
sartin. Go home and sleep it off? Yes, I guess not.
I’ll just hang round here a little longer, and if there’s
another chance, I’ll make one mouthful of it, and say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
“Sally&mdash;” O, consarn it, Jarius, you darsn’t. You’re

Who could it have been? It must have been Jarius, on
his nightly visit. Sally’s light is still burning in the
kitchen. I’ll just pick up my work, and off to bed. Can
it be possible that Will forged that check? I don’t believe
it. Henry Douglas must have invented that story
to frighten me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Will</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, softly.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Poor boy, I wish he were safe home again!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Mary&mdash;sister!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Rushing into his arms.</i>) O, Will, dear Will,
is it you at last?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Hush! Don’t wake anybody. I wouldn’t be
seen by any one but you for the world. You see, I got
awful homesick, wanted to have a look at the old home,
and, if possible, speak with you. But I don’t want to
meet father or mother.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Don’t want to meet them! O, Will, your city
life&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Is splendid! I’m rising in the world&mdash;I am.
That’s the place for me. Busy all day, and at night seeing
the sights. O, it’s gay! I’m doing well. But I
shall never meet father until I am rich enough to say,
“I was right, and you were wrong. I should have been
on the bench now had I listened to you; but I asserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
my rights, went into the world, and have come back rich,
powerful, influential.” Ahem. That’s the style in which
I shall meet him one of these days.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Will, are you still in the employ of Mr. Douglas?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> No. I’m on my own account.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> O, Heavens! ’tis true, ’tis true!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> What’s true, Mary?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> The forged check.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Eh? What forged check?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Henry Douglas told me to-night that you had
forged his name to a check for two hundred dollars.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> ’Tis a lie! an infamous lie!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> He said you denied it.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> We have never spoken concerning a check. I
have had nothing to do with his money matters.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> But you have parted?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Because he wished me to testify falsely in a
case in which he was concerned&mdash;to perjure myself. I
refused; and for that reason, and that alone, we parted.
Mary, I may be wild and reckless, but, believe me, I have
never committed a crime&mdash;never.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I do believe you, Will. ’Tis but another proof
of his perfidy.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Never mind him, Mary. He’s not worthy of a
thought. Tell me of father and mother. Are they
well?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah, Will, your conduct has made them ten
years older. Father will not allow your name to be
mentioned, and mother, at his bidding, is silent; but her
face is careworn, her step feeble, and the nervous start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
she gives when the door opens tells how anxiously she
awaits your return. You will see her, Will?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Not to-night, Mary. In an hour I must be on
my way back to the city. Mary, I wish I had not come
here. There’s a power in the old house that makes my
heart ache, it awakens such memories! And mother,
dear soul, how sadly her bright hopes of her boy have
been shattered! Though I have dashed into the city,
and been swept along by its hurry and whirl, I have
often thought of this quiet house, and ached, fairly ached,
to feel mother’s arms around my neck, and her goodnight
kiss upon my brow. O, Mary, be tender, very
tender with her. Don’t let her hear a word against me.
Sometimes I think that fierce temptation will overwhelm
me, ruin me, body and soul; and that would break her
heart.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> O, Will, stay with us. Here you are safe
from all temptations.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Here? Why, Mary, you forget the little brown
jug, which first tempted me to drink, which created a
thirst, which, fight against as I will, must be quenched.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah; but the little brown jug will not tempt
you now. Since that day there has been no more brewing
of strong drink. Father has abandoned it, and the
old jug has been put to a better use.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> A better use?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes. ’Tis now placed in the cupboard in father’s
room, and every Saturday night he places in it
the sum of money he would have expended for liquor
during the week. There’s quite a large sum there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Will.</i> That’s very queer. In father’s cupboard, you
say?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes. But you do not inquire after Ned.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Ned Hartshorn? Is he here still?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Will, are you ignorant of his severe illness?
Did not Mr. Douglas tell you?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Nothing concerning Ned Hartshorn. I haven’t
heard his name before for a year.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Douglas’s deceit again! Will, for a year he
has not left the house. That blow with the jug, a year
ago, nearly killed him.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> What! And I knew nothing of it? O, this
is terrible! That man is a fiend! He has tried to keep
from me all knowledge of you and my family, for what
reason I cannot guess. But I will know. Ned Hartshorn
nearly killed, and by my hand! I am accursed! Let
me fly from this place!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No, no, Will; not now, not now!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> I will! I must! What right have I to stand
beneath this roof? I have defied my father, chosen my
own path in life, turned my back upon you all, and have
no right to claim kindred here. Let me go, Mary. ’Tis
better for all. There’s a curse upon me, a bitter curse.
Let me go! let me go!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No, no, brother. (<i>Clings about his neck.</i>) I
will not release you. We love you dearly.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Then pray for me, think of me kindly if you
can; but part we must. (<i>Kisses her.</i>) Mary, sister,
Heaven bless you! (<i>Rushes out, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Gone. Poor boy! I tremble for him, swayed
by every impulse of his wayward nature, in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of temptation; his young life already poisoned by the love
of drink, what must be his fate! O, brother, may Heaven
send some good angel to reclaim you, and hear a mother’s
and a sister’s prayers in your behalf. (<i>Takes light
from table, and exits, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Door opens, softly. Enter <span class="smcap">Will</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Homeless and friendless! She little knows it
has come to that. She little knows that my threat to
acquaint my father with his wild doings parted Douglas
and I. He marry her! Not if I can prevent it. But
what power have I with my stubborn father? Douglas
has trumped up his charge of forgery to frighten me and
intimidate her. How can I alarm her and father? I
came to tell her, and have not spoken a word against
him. But I will find a way. Just now I must care for
myself. I haven’t had a morsel to eat to-day, so my
good mother’s cupboard must provide. If I could only
have one good pull at the little brown jug! I forgot.
’Tis now put to better use. Better? There’s money in
it; and money will provide both food and shelter. Why
not? Haven’t I a right to put my fingers in it? Yes,
you have put it to a better use, father, and, with your
good leave, I’ll have a pull at it, as in former days. Egad,
it’s a capital joke. There’s no crime about it, for it’s all
in the family, and one member mustn’t starve while others
hoard wealth. I’ll creep into father’s room, secure
the jug, help myself, and nobody shall be the wiser.
Softly, my boy, softly. (<i>Creeps out, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

Sally! (<i>Enters window, or door.</i>) Blamed if I ain’t

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Seizing him by collar.</i>) Jes’ so. So have I.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Ah! Discovered! Who are you, scoundrel?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Who are you, thief? (<i>Drags him to moonlight.</i>)
Will Nutter!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Jarius Jordan!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Wal, I never! Will Nutter a thief!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Thief? ’Tis false.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Snatching jug from him.</i>) Here is the
proof. O, Will, young feller, has it come to this?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> What right have you meddling here? This is
my father’s house. Haven’t I a right to pass in and out
of it when I please?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so; but not to rob the old man. What
right have I to meddle? The right which every honest
man should be proud to exercise&mdash;the right to battle
wrong wherever found. Young feller, you’ve made my
heart ache to-night. To see the boy we were all so proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of sneaking out of his father’s house a thief! It’s too
bad!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Jarius Jordan, once more I tell you I’m no
thief.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Will you tell your father so, when I arouse
him, as I mean to?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> No, no, Jarius; don’t do that. Let me go as
I came. Keep the jug, if you please; only let me go.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Will Nutter, young feller, you’re going to
destruction as fast as your legs can carry you. Where’s
your pride? Where’s your grand expectations, that you
raved so about, a year ago? Why, you’re the meanest
of all critters&mdash;a thief.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> That name again?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Yes; again and again. I ain’t agoin’ to be
mealy-mouthed on this subject, anyhow. You see what
yer fine friend has brought ye to; for it’s all his work.
I’ve watched ye in the city all through yer year of service
with him. I’ve seen the temptations spread by him like
a spider, and you, poor little fly, walk into them. It all
came of his trickery. And now here you are, crawling
into the room where your poor mother is sleeping&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> O, don’t, Jarius; don’t speak of my mother!
What would she say to know that her poor boy was a&mdash;a&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Thief! Say it, Will, young feller. Git the
bile all out of yer system. Look at yerself as ye are;
feel as mean as ye look. You are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> A thief! Yes, Jarius, it’s the truth. O, why
did I come here? Why add this horror to a life already
made wretched by my folly? I never dreamed of this. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was a sudden impulse. I never gave a thought to it.
It came upon me unawares. But now I see its wickedness.
O, Jarius, why can’t I die? (<i>Sinks on floor,
covers face with hands.</i>) Why can’t I die? I haven’t a
friend in the world to care for me now.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Yes, you have. Look up, Will. I never
went back on a feller-critter, good or bad, when in distress,
and I ain’t a goin’ to do it now. Look up, young
feller. I’ll help you out;</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Help me? You! Then show me how to help
myself. Show me some way to wipe out this disgrace,
and I will bless you.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Listen to me. A year ago, of your own accord,
you set out to seek your fortune with Hen Douglas&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Yesterday we parted, for his service was too
mean for me to perform.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. You’ve had a year of his tuition;
will you now take a year of mine?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Yours, Jarius?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Yes, mine. I wanted you then, but, Douglas
eucred me. I want you now. Will you serve me?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Willingly, and bless you for the chance.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Young feller, you’ve only seen the
dark side of life. You’ve been dipped into temptation;
but hang on to me and I’ll pull you out. There’s my
hand.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> And there’s mine.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Hold on a minute. Let’s understand things.
There’s got to be a rippin’ away of old associations&mdash;no
billiards, no cards, no theatres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Will.</i> There’s my hand.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Hold on a minute. You’re to stick to all I
ask, although it goes agin the grain.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> There’s my hand.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Hold on a minute. Here’s the hardest. You
must solemnly promise that for one year you will never
touch, taste, or handle liquor, plain or embellished, raw
or fancy. It’s hard, young feller, for you, but it’s your
only hope.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> It is, indeed, Jarius. Heaven bless you! You
are a true friend. As you speak, I feel the strength of
your good, noble heart animating mine. Yours is the
first warning voice that has ever reached my ears, and I
will heed it. Do with me as you will. I promise.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Nuff sed; shake. (<i>They stand in
centre of stage, with clasped hands, as the curtain slowly
descends.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>John.</i> It’s no use argifying, Ned. It can’t be; it shan’t
be. Mary gin her promise to Henry Douglas more than
a year ago, an’ she’s got to stick tew it. I ain’t a goin’
to have no flirts about me.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> But she does not love him, sir; she is truly attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to me. You surely would not have her break her
heart.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Better break it than break her promise, and
break his heart.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> There is no fear of breaking his; he has none.
He is unworthy of her.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now, Ned, don’t be mean. Don’t speak ill
of a man because he is likely to win where you may
lose.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> I speak the truth. Mary has told him she did
not love him, and asked him to release her. He refused.
He’s a mean, contemptible sneak, unworthy any woman’s
love. That one act stamps him so.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now stop. That’s enough. I know Henry
Douglas better than you. He has been a good friend
to me, and I won’t have him abused. When, a year ago,
I emptied the little brown jug of my savings, and found,
to my surprise, a handsome sum, he showed me a grand
chance for a safe investment. I took his advice, and
doubled my money in a month. He helped me to other
investments.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> I know. Some of them paid and some didn’t.
The balance is on the wrong side, for your money has
vanished, and there’s a mortgage of a thousand dollars on
your property, which he holds. Pretty friend he!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Well, what of it? Them as win must expect
to lose sometimes. It’s no use your talkin’ agin him.
He’s smart, and he’ll help me out, with a handsome profit,
when the time comes right.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> And for his sake you refuse to let Mary marry
the man of her choice?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><i>John.</i> <em>He</em> was the man of her choice. I’m only a
givin’ him justice. Now look a-here, Ned; let’s have no
more of this. I think a heap of you. You’re a smart
workman; and I’d like to see you married. Mary’s already
engaged. (<i>Rises.</i>) Think no more of her. If
you want a smart wife,</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Jes’ so. Guess I didn’t come back
any tew soon. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Ned!</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> (<i>Turning, sees <span class="smcap">Jarius</span>.</i>) Jarius Jordan!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Heow air yer, young feller? (<i>Shake
hands.</i>) And heow’s everybody?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Glad to see you once more. It must be a year
since you were here.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so; a year to-day. Folks all well?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Yes&mdash;no; Mother Nutter is poorly; the rest
are hearty.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Sally Peeslee smart&mdash;hey? By the by,
didn’t I hear John Nutter say somethin’ about your makin’
up to her?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> <em>You</em> need fear no rival in me, Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Expected you and Mary would have
made a match. P’raps you have.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> No. We are warmly attached; but Mr. Nutter
will not hear of our marrying. He wants to give her
to Henry Douglas.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> The old fool! Nothin’ personal in that remark.
But he’s wus than a nine-days’-old pup&mdash;hain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
got his eyes open. Wal, what air ye goin’ to do ’bout
it&mdash;give her up?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Never! I scarcely know what to do. Douglas
has almost ruined the old man with speculation. Everything
is mortgaged to him; and if Mary does not marry
him, he will turn them out of their home.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Sho! How much is the mortgage?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> A thousand dollars.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Wal, don’t yeou fret, young feller. I’ll see
yeou through. I’ve got a bone to pick with that air
chap; and, keen as he thinks himself, he’s got to git up
airly if he gits ahead of Jarius Jordan. Hullo, here’s
Mary!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Well, Ned, what does he say?&mdash;Why, Mr.
Jordan!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Heow d’ye do? (<i>Shake hands.</i>)
Prettier than ever, I declare!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> This is an unexpected pleasure. We haven’t
seen you for a long time.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. But Ned don’t say what he said.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> He refused me, Mary. He says you must keep
your promise to Douglas.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Never. I’ll die first.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Good grit. Neow, young folks, I
always was famous for meddlin’; and I’m goin’ to help
you in this matter, if you’ll let me. Douglas has a hold
on the old gent with a mortgage. I understand that.
Anything else?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> He holds a check, which he declares was forged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his name used, and the money drawn from the bank by
Will. This he has threatened to use against my brother.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. A forged check? That’s an old
trick. You don’t happen to know what bank it was drawn
on&mdash;do you?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> He told me. Let me think a moment. The
Phœnix Bank.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> The Phœnix? Sho! I’ve got him! (<i>Goes,
to table, takes a tablet from his pocket, and writes with a
pencil.</i>) Neow, then, young feller, I want to use yer. If
yeou want Mary, jest put on your hat, and leg it to the
telegraph office. Here’s a message; put it through, and
wait for an answer. (<i>Tears out leaf, and gives it to
<span class="smcap">Ned</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> But what does this mean?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Business. Don’t ask any questions; but go.
If yeou git the answer I expect, I’ll eucre Douglas in
spite of thunder.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Will you? Then I’m off.&mdash;Will you go,
Mary?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> No; Mary will stay here. Where’s your politeness?
Ain’t I company?</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> All right, Mr. Jordan. I’m off. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Well, Mary, heow’s yer marm?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> She’s very sick, Mr. Jordan. She keeps her
room most of the time. My brother’s conduct, my father’s
wild speculations, and the persistent wooing of
Henry Douglas,&mdash;whom she detests,&mdash;have made her
very miserable.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Wal, we’ll see if we can’t doctor
her up. Now, Mary, the next time Douglas comes here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
don’t you be mealy-mouthed. Let him have it right and
left. Tell him jest what you think of him, and defy him
to do his worst.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I dare not. He is wicked enough to crush
father with the mortgage he holds, and mean enough to
kill mother by disclosing Will’s connection with the
forged check.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Let him do his worst, Mary. He’s a crafty
chap, a-schemin to snare the old man and get your hand;
but there’s a weak p’int somewhere in his net, and if I
can find it I’ll holler.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I’ll obey you, Mr. Jordan. Only put an end
to this terrible persecution, and you will make me happy.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Hullo! there’s Sally. Now I’ve
got something particular to say to her, and if you don’t
mind taking a hasty leave, I’ll be obliged to ye.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> O, certainly. Ahem! Mr. Jordan, you’re sure
you have the courage to speak now?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Neow yeou git eout! Want to make a feller
feel cheap&mdash;don’t yeou?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ha, ha! Mr. Jordan, you’ve a brave heart,
but you dare not ask her. See if I am not right. Good
by. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Darsn’t ask Sally to be my wife? Don’t think
I’m such a blarsted fool neow. Arter staying away a

<p><i>Sally.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Mary, Mary! Where on airth

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Dunno, Sally. Here’s a man <em>come</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Jarius Jerden! Wal, I never! How d’ye
do?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Purty well, Sally. (<i>Shake hands.</i>) Sally,
you are a bouncer, and no mistake!</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Where yeou been this long while? Come back
for good?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Wal, that depends. Sally, yeou dew look
jest about good enough to eat.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Do I? (<i>Aside.</i>) Law sakes; how his eyes
blaze! I believe he’s going to pop. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I’m making
pickles.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Making pickles? (<i>Aside.</i>) She’s pickled
me, long ago.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Yes; and I want the mangoes. Somebody’s
hid ’em. I must find Mary. (<i>Crosses to <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Don’t go, Sally; I want to speak to yeou. If
you leave me neow, I won’t answer for the consequences.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) O, dear; I’m afraid of him! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
What is it, Mr. Jerden? (<i>Edging off, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) How skeery she is! Wonder
what’s the matter! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Sally, I’m goin’ to do
somethin’ desperate, for the sight of yeou has set me on
fire. I feel&mdash;I feel that the hour has come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I can’t bear it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Dear
me; this place hain’t been dusted to-day. (<i>Takes her
apron, and runs about dusting table, chair, and lounge.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I swow, she’s skeered! All right,
Jarius; now’s yer chance. (<i>Runs after <span class="smcap">Sally</span>; brings
her down, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Sally, it’s no use; yeou must hear me.
Sally, do yeou know what it is to be in&mdash;in&mdash;in&mdash;love?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) He’s going to pop! (<i>Aloud.</i>) O,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
them plants! (<i>Runs up, <span class="smcapuc">L. C.</span></i>) They haven’t been watered
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) How she does carry on! (<i>Runs
after her, and brings her down, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>) Now look a-here,
Sally; it’s no use. You’ll spile everything.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> O, my pickles! they’ll spile! Do let me go,
Mr. Jerden.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Putting his arm round her waist.</i>) Let ’em
spile! I’ve got yeou fast, Sally, and I’m going to try
and keep yeou for ever and ever.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> (<i>Struggling to get away.</i>) Mr. Jerden, I’m
ashamed of you.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> I’m ashamed of myself, Sally. To think I’ve
been so mealy-mouthed! What bright eyes you’ve got!
and rosy cheeks! and such a mouth! I declare, I must
have a kiss!</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Don’t yeou dew it, Mr. Jerden.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> I can’t help it, Sally. I never saw a sugar
bowl but what I wanted to git my fingers into it, or a
’lasses barrel but what I wanted to lick it. And a mouth
like yours!&mdash;Jehu, don’t stop me! (<i>Kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Aha! (<i><span class="smcap">Sally</span> screams, and runs off, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Aha, yerself, and see heow yeou
like it.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Jarius Jordan! You back again?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so, and likely to stop a spell.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> I should judge so from the warm welcome
you have just received. Is the day fixed&mdash;hey?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Wal, not exactly. I’m kinder waitin’ for
you and Mary. Is the day fixed&mdash;hey?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Ha! You are sarcastic. They tell me you
have made a great deal of money, Jordan.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Wal, I ain’t as poor as a church mouse.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> That’s good. Our old friend Nutter has
got into difficulties; wants money. Now you are just
the chap to help him.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Guess not. I don’t throw my money away
for nothin’. What I git I keep.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Good. No fear of him. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
That’s right. Don’t let him wheedle you out of it; for,
between you and me, he’s a ruined man.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. He’s a good old chap; but I’ve
heard he’s been speculatin’, and is bound to end in the
poorhouse. Wal, they’ve got a purty good one here,
and’ll make him comfortable. Here comes his darter.
I won’t spile your fun as you did mine. I’ve got a
heap of business to attend tew. Good day. (<i>Aside.</i>)
Darn your ugly picter, <em>your</em> day <em>is</em> fixed.
(<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Rich and mean. All the better for me; he
will not mar my project; and to-day I will give Mary
my ultimatum&mdash;her hand, or her father’s ruin.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent">Ah, Mary, you are looking finely to-day!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Thank you, Mr. Douglas. Father is at home.
I will call him. (<i>Crosses to <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> No. By your leave, I would have a word
with you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Certainly, if you wish it. (<i>Sits in chair <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> of
table.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> (<i>Brings chair down <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, and sits.</i>) Mary, I
have come to-day to revive a topic upon which I have
been silent a year.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> You come again to ask me to marry you. I
have been expecting this visit.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> And you are prepared with an answer?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I am.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Stop one moment, Mary. Before you give
me that answer, hear me. You must believe that I love
you. This long year, during which I have been almost
a constant visitor, looking upon you with wistful eyes,
yet with a silent tongue, for fear of your displeasure,
coming and going, must be convincing proof that, spite
of your coldness, your image is enshrined within my
heart.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Mr. Douglas, the man who truly loves a woman
shows his devotion by making her happy, even at
the cost of his own happiness.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> You’re right, Mary. ’Tis your happiness I
seek when I ask you to become my wife. I would not
see you throw yourself away upon a poor man, when I
have the power to surround you with every comfort, and
a heart overflowing with love, that cannot fail to make
you happy.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Enough. You and I can never agree. My
answer a year ago was final.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Pray reconsider it. If not for my sake,
for that of your father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Whom you have persistently wooed for the
last year. What of him?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> He has met with reverse of fortune. He
is now a poor man, so poor that, but for my friendly aid,
he would have no home to shelter him.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Rising.</i>) Your friendly aid! ’Twas you
who led him into speculation; you who, by crafty advice,
swept away his little store of hard-earned savings; you,
who now stand over his home ready to crush it if I, his
daughter, dare refuse you my hand!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Nay, Mary, you are harsh. Calm yourself.
Out of my deep love for you I have endeavored to better
his worldly condition. If I have failed in my designs&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> You have failed, Henry Douglas. My father
is in your power, ’tis true. You can at any moment
drive him from his home. In that design you have triumphed.
But beyond that you have miserably failed.
Though my father should curse me, should drive me from
my home for my disobedience, I will never marry you&mdash;never!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Ah, you’ll think better of it, Mary. I have
spent a great deal of money to help him. He owes me
a large sum. With you my wife, I could not be hard
with him. Without you, I must deal with him justly,
man to man, and claim my own.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Claim it at once. Drive us forth, for then
comes my triumph. There’s a brave, true man waiting
for me. Already we have planned a new home, where
my parents will be tenderly cared for, and two loving
hearts and four willing hands will rebuild all your craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
has destroyed. Ay, Henry Douglas, do your worst!
You are a villain, and I hate and defy you!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> (<i>Rising.</i>) Enough. Mary Nutter, I will
take you at your word. I <em>will</em> do my worst. You have
turned all my love to hate. I’ll woo no more. But,
mark me, your father shall be driven from his home;
your lover&mdash;curse him!&mdash;shall be shot like a dog,
though I hang for it!</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> (<i>Outside, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) Mary, dear! Mary!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Hark! There’s the voice of one very, very
dear to you. You have defied me, Mary. I’ll strike my
first blow there.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> My mother! No, no. You would not be so
cruel. Spare her, I entreat you!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> No, no. You are too late.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Hannah</span>, feebly, <span class="smcapuc">R.</span>, in a white wrapper.</i></p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Mary, Mary, dear! don’t you hear me?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Running to her, and leading her to lounge.</i>)
Yes, mother; I was just coming. Why did you leave
your room?</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> It was so lonesome there, Mary, dear; and,
you know, to-day is Will’s birthday. Yes, to-day he is
a man. And I have felt all day that I should see him;
that to-day he would think of his poor mother, and find
the way home to her.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes, mother, it is his birthday; but he is far,
far away.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Yes; but not too far away to reach his
mother. I remember, as though it were but yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
when he was twelve years old. What a bright, noble
boy he was! He came to my side, put his arms about
my neck, and said, “Mother, I shall soon be a man!”
Dear boy, he was a brave little man then. “And when
I am a man, the first thing I shall do will be to run to
you and kiss you, and thank you for making me a good,
true man.” Dear boy! and I haven’t seen him for two
years! and he don’t write to me; and you all look strange
when I ask for him. But he’ll come to-day, I know he
will, for he promised; and he never broke a promise he
gave his mother&mdash;never.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Ah, it’s shameful, shameful that a boy with
so good a mother should turn out so bad!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.</i>) Hush! For Heaven’s sake
be merciful!</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> What’s that! Who spoke? Who said my
boy turned out bad?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Nobody, mother. Don’t mind that man. He’s
deceived himself. It’s Henry Douglas.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Henry Douglas? What does he know
about my Will?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Too much. He has deceived me. I thought
him a true, noble boy; but he robbed me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Jarius</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Jes’ so. He’s got to work. Where
on airth is that Ned?</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Robbed you! My Will? ’Tis false!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> I’m sorry to say ’tis true.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Mr. Douglas, have you no pity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> You would have it so, Mary. I am not to
blame.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Consarn it, why don’t that boy
come. (<i>He fidgets in the doorway, looking off, and then
watching <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Yes, Mrs. Nutter; I am sorry to distress
you; but ’tis best you know the truth. While in my
employ, Will robbed me of two hundred dollars.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> No, no; you are mistaken. My boy, my
noble boy! I’ll not believe it.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Consarn his ugly picter! I shall
split! Where is that boy?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Yes, he robbed me; forged my name to a
check. ’Tis here. (<i>Showing check.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> O, Heavens! My boy! my boy!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Drew the money from the bank&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(<i><span class="smcap">Ned</span> appears, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> Gives <span class="smcap">Jarius</span> a telegram.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Villain, you are killing her.&mdash;Mother, ’tis
false! ’tis false!</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> ’Tis true. I can prove it.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Coming down <span class="smcapuc">C.</span>, with telegram.</i>) Jes’ so.
(<i>Snatches the check.</i>) Phœnix Bank: two hundred dollars.
Humbug! that’s no forgery.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> No forgery? Is not that my name?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. But here’s a little telegram from the
Phœnix Bank. (<i>Reads.</i>) “Have examined the books.
Henry Douglas never had funds in our bank.”</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Fool! what business have you to meddle in
this matter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Why, bless your soul, I’m one of the directors
in that air Phœnix.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Confusion!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Mrs. Nutter, don’t be scart. Will’s
all right on that p’int.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> I knew he was. Poor boy, he has enemies
who would rob him of his good name.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. But this ere sneak didn’t make much
of a speck when <em>he</em> tried it on. Mr. Douglas, I’d git
eout if I was in yeour place.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Mr. Jarius Jordan, your bare assertion that
you are a director in this bank will not serve. I still
hold my charge of forgery against Will Nutter.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Well, you hold it. It won’t hurt
anybody if it goes off; but I’m inclined to think it’ll kick
like thunder.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">John</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ah, Douglas! I’ve been up to see you. I’m
all anxiety to hear from the Carom stock. Has it gone up?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> No; but the mine has.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Gracious Heaven! Then I am ruined! (<i>Sinks
into chair <span class="smcapuc">L.</span> of table, and buries his face in his hands.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Yes, old man, you’ve nothing left but your
house and shop; and they must go to repay me.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> What! You will not close on me?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> I must. I want the money.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, you told me you would wait; that when
you married Mary you would give it up. Won’t you
wait?</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> No; that would be too long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I shall never marry him, father.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> But you must&mdash;you shall. I’ll have no disobedience.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Father, father, Mary is a good girl. Don’t
speak of disobedience.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> She shall marry Henry Douglas.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Never, John Nutter! I would not marry
your daughter were she at my feet entreating me to take
her to my arms. (<i>Folds his arms.</i>) She’s not my style.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> What, you miserable whelp! Do you know where
you are&mdash;who you are speaking to? You have entreated
me to give her to you; you have begged me to exert
my power, and drive her to your arms; and, now that
you have me in your power, you dare to insult her! Villain,
I’ll strangle you! (<i>Rushes at <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> (<i>Rushing between.</i>) Hold on. Keep cool,
Mr. Nutter.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> I want nothing that belongs to you, old
man, but my money; that I will have. Pay me one
thousand dollars, or I take immediate possession of your
property.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> O, I am justly served! I listened to your
voice, embarked in speculation, turned against my daughter’s
love, and now, in my old age, must wander forth
without a home.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> It’s rather hard. Keep the home, and pay
the money. It’s easy enough.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Pay the money, and let the sneak
go.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> How can I? I haven’t a cent in the world.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Where’s the little brown jug?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Alas, that is empty!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Sho! Let’s have a look at it.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> ’Tis useless. I haven’t put a copper into it for
a year. Everything has gone to that villain.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Let’s see the jug for old acquaintance’
sake. (<i>Exit, <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></i>) It’s a bad thing to give
up putting away a little somethin’ for a rainy day, ain’t it,
Mrs. Nutter?</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Yes. John always did save until that
Henry Douglas showed him how to spend.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. It’s a great pity. I could tell you
a story about a boy I knowed.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> A boy! What boy?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Why, how bright you are looking, Mrs. Nutter!
Guess you feel better.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> Well, is my money coming?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Hold on. Don’t git into a sweat. I want to
tell yer about that air boy. Yer see, about a year ago
I came across a poor chap, who’d run down hill awful
fast; he’d got into temptation, and tripped. A good deal
like your boy, Mrs. Nutter.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> My Will? He was a good boy. He’s a
man to-day.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Wal, this here chap wanted work.
He was as penitent as could be; so I set him to work
among agricultural implements, as a sort of salesman,
paid him fair wages, and a smarter chap you never
see. I noticed he never spent much, and so one day
I asked him what he did with his savings. He didn’t
like to tell at first; but arter a while he told me that his
daddy had a kind of saving-up place&mdash;a sugar-bowl, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a coffee-pot, or a jug, somewhere, and he used to walk
off every Saturday night ten miles, creep into the house,
and put it away in the old ju&mdash;savings bank. Wal, I
had a reapin’ machine that I had a patent onto, that I
thought a heap on; but, somehow, it wouldn’t work.
When they got the horses in, and a boy on top of it, and
started the thing off, for a little while ’twould go first
rate; when, all at once, there’d be a h’ist and spill, and
machine, and horse, and boy would all be mixed up in a
heap. It was a bust. Wal, that air boy would look,
and look, and look at that machine, and one day he says
to me, “I’ve found what’s the matter.” And I’ll be
hanged if he hadn’t. I was so tickled that I jest drew
my check for a thousand dollars, and made him a present
of it; and I’ll be bound that air check is in the old
gentleman’s little brown jug.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Outside.</i>) O, father! mother! (<i>Runs in,
<span class="smcapuc">L.</span>, with jug, followed by <span class="smcap">Sally</span>.</i>) The jug! the jug!
It’s heaped full of bank notes. (<i>Emptying it upon
table.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Heaps and heaps!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Bank notes, and&mdash;What’s this? (<i>Takes up
check.</i>) A check! “Pay to William Nutter, or order,
one thousand dollars.” Signed, “Jarius Jordan.” Jordan,
is this your work?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Look at the back.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> (<i>Reads.</i>) “William Nutter.” My son!</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Our Will! My boy! O, Jarius Jordan!
what does this mean?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> It means glory! Halleluyah! Fourth of July!
Kingdom come! It’s a grand emancipation jubilee. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
boy I’ve been telling you about is the same boy that villain,
Henry Douglas, led into temptation, whom he
charged with forgery, whom I took in hand, set straight,
and who to-day is a man indeed&mdash;your son Will, Mrs.
Nutter.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> I know it, I know it. He’s saved us, he’s
saved us! O, where is he? Where is my boy?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Will</span>, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Here, mother, here’s your own boy again.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> (<i>Screams.</i>) O, Will! Will! I knew you’d
come! I knew you’d come! (<i>Runs into his arms.</i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Will, welcome home! (<i>Takes his hand.</i>) Everything
is forgotten and forgiven. I’m proud to welcome
my son home again.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Home, father, spite of the craft of that man
whom I once called friend. It is ours still.&mdash;Mary,
sister!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Dear, dear Will, a thousand times welcome!
(<i>Clasps his hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Ah, sister, I have missed you all. Thank
Heaven, I am once more able to meet you without a blush
of shame.</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Here’s your old chum, Will; can you spare a
hand for him?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> (<i>Giving both hands to <span class="smcap">Ned</span>. <span class="smcap">Mary</span> leads her
mother to lounge.</i>) Ah, Ned, you have much to forgive.
That cruel blow with the little brown jug!</p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Don’t speak of it. You don’t know how much
good it did me. Does he, Mary?</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. If it did you any good, give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
credit where it belongs&mdash;to Henry Douglas, for he
struck the blow.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> ’Tis false.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> It’s the truth, for I saw the act. I didn’t tell
on it, for I wanted a p’int agin Douglas. To-morrow I
shall make a charge of assault with intent to kill. It’s
hung two years, but I guess it’s strong enough to do
some execution.</p>

<p><i>Douglas.</i> You have no witnesses. Your charge will
fall to the ground, Mr. Jarius Jordan. You have outwitted
me, but you must confess I have plotted safely.
There’s not a point you’ve found to convict me of crime.
You are rather keen. Try it. If I have failed in my attempt
to ruin the family of the renowned shoemaker, John
Nutter, I have still the satisfaction of retiring from the
field with a very handsome profit in the shape of your check
for a thousand dollars, which I shall expect to receive before
night. Good day, all. Nutter, I leave you to join
the hands of your daughter and her accomplished lover.
Give them your blessing, and send me a card. (<i>At door.</i>)
Ha, ha, farewell to Cobbler’s Paradise! (<i>Exit, <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> (<i>Runs up to door.</i>) Good riddance to bad
rubbish.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Sally, Sally, don’t do that. (<i>Runs after her,
and brings her down <span class="smcapuc">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Jarius Jerden, if there’s a Yankee angel, you’re
the critter.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Sally, I want to ask you&mdash;that is&mdash;I’m going
to&mdash;Consarn it! Sally, will you marry me? Phew!
it’s out at last!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Of course I will. I would five years ago, if
you’d only had the spunk to ask me.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. I’ve been a donkey. But them
words did stick in my wizzen awful.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> (<i>Rising.</i>) Law sakes, Mary, don’t try to
keep me on this sofa. I ain’t a bit sick. I’m just as
well as you are; and if I don’t dance at your weddin’,
it’ll be because I hain’t got a partner.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> You shall not want for partners, mother. I
claim the privilege of opening the ball with you.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> And you shall, Will. Law, my! how handsome
you have grown!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Hasn’t he, mother! This is a proud day
for us.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Yes, indeed; for Will’s a man to-day.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> And, if I am, I owe it all to one who, in the
dark hour, took me by the hand and led me into the light.
Ah, many a poor boy who has been led into temptation
might be saved from a miserable life if a friendly hand
were stretched forth, and a warning word kindly given,
as they were to me by Jarius Jordan&mdash;Heaven bless
him!</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Ay, Heaven bless you, Jarius. You have
made a mother’s heart happy in the gift of her boy, reclaimed
from sin. May all you seek be yours.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so&mdash;which is Sally. I’ve got her. As
there’s likely to be a matrimonial convention in this house
pretty soon, I appint myself a delegate.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Second the motion.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ned, I withdraw all objections to your proposal
regarding Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ned.</i> Thank you, Mr. Nutter.&mdash;Mary, are you going
to make me happy?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I’m going to try, Ned. And where there’s a
will there’s a way, you know.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Mother, you don’t know how happy I feel to
be with you again, to see the old home, everything about
the room so familiar; even the little brown jug has a
familiar look. It was my first temptation.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Yes, boy, it was a family temptation. I
knowed it would work trouble. Ah, if the liquid poison
that slays was never allowed to show itself in the home,
there would be fewer desolate hearthstones, fewer blighted
lives.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> You’re right, Jarius. When that boy fell, it
opened my eyes, and not a drop of liquor shall ever enter
my doors.</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Jes’ so. Stick to it, John Nutter. It was a
bad speck. It turned your boy adrift; but, thanks to a
mother’s love, he fought and conquered.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> (<i>Comes up and takes <span class="smcap">Jarius’s</span> hand.</i>) Thanks
to you, thanks to you!</p>

<p><i>Jarius.</i> Wal, I dunno&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> (<i>Comes and takes <span class="smcap">Jarius’s</span> other hand.</i>) Jes’
so, Jarius, jes’ so.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
